# hello-world
The first steps are always the hardest, but all the more worth it.

Huh?! How did I get here? Last thing I can remember was, that I stept in this blue phone box.
I don't why, I was just curious. I mean you don't see that very often. 
Ya, so old was it. I think my grand-grand-dad told us storys far back when is still lived on mars. 
Wow I miss that planet... Anyways.. I lost myself there a bit. Can you show me a way out here, by any chance?
